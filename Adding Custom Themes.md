# Adding Custom Themes to [LightPaper] [themes]

**LightPaper** comes bundled with some nice styles for both editor and preview such as *LightPaper Light*, *LightPaper Dark*, *Solarized Dark*, *Solarized Light* etc. Some styles are only avaiable for either editor or preview such as *Dracula*, *GitHub* etc.

## Styles for your code

**LightPaper** also supports syntax highlighting for your code out of the box and comes bundled with some great syntax highlighting styles.

```javascript
	function isLightPaperAwesome() { return true; }
```

## Write your own theme
You can also write your own themes or use already available themes by just dropping them under `~/.lightpaper/Themes` directory. You can also put themes under a subdirectory as well as just clone a repo and **LightPaper** will pick them up without any extra efforts on your side. Files ending in `.txt` are counted as editor themes while files ending in `.css` are counted as preview themes. 

Here are some of the themes that are already available publicly on GitHub that you can use right away:

1. [Dashing Theme by @designerJordan] [1]
2. [Theme by hzlzh] [2]
3. [Clearness Dark Plus by Staudi] [3]
4. [Byword Theme by kvanlierop] [4]
5. [Kublai Theme by moizk] [5]
6. [Verona Theme by MSpirek] [6]
7. [Solarized Theme by CodeCatalyst] [7]
8. [Github2 Theme by gcollazo] [8]
9. [Mou Themes by jessemutz] [9]
10. [mou-theme by samrayner] [10]
11. [Swizzle by chrissimpkins] [11]
12. [Snowball by chrissimpkins] [12]
13. [Flatland by Kikobeats] [13]
14. [PrintPretty by a1ee9b] [14]

Clone one or all of the above themes under `~/.lightpaper/Themes` and you are all set. You can select a theme for the editor and/ or for the preview from the Preferences pane (`LightPaper>Preferences…` or `⌘,`). If two themes share the same name, only one of them will be picked. If you want to write your own theme, we recommend you to use one of the above mentioned themes as a template.
