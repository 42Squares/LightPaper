## Introducing LightPaper Mini

[LightPaper] [lightpaper] version 1.2 comes with a companion mini app embedded within. This app sits in your Mac status bar and allows you to take quick notes. Although it is called `Mini`, don't underestimate the power it possesses - it has full markdown support, including highlighting, and allows you to preview your markdown notes without having to make a round trip to it's big brother - [LightPaper] [lightpaper].

There are actually two different types of notes you can take  from LightPaper Mini - `Scratch Notes` and `Shadow Notes`. We'll talk more about `Shadow Notes` in a future post but `Scratch Note` is exactly what you think it is - taking quick scratch/ draft notes. 

Once you have added the notes, you can fire up [LightPaper] [lightpaper] to see all your scratch notes. You can then continue editing them or save them as regular Markdown files.

You actually don't have to do anything to get LightPaper Mini other than being on an OS X 10.10 or higher and launching [LightPaper] [lightpaper] once. LightPaper Mini is a startup app so every time you log in to your system, it is going to get added to the status bar for your convenience. If you don't like it as a startup item, you can go to `Preferences > General` and turn it off. 

The great thing about LightPaper Mini is that it's absolutely free for our new and existing users. No "in-app purchase" nonsense.
