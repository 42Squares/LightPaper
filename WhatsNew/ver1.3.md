#### IMPROVEMENTS üíÑüíÑüíÑ

* LightPaper now re-renders your document when you make any changes to your sidebar's root folder(s). This makes it to render your new/modified images without having to restart LightPaper, for an example.

    * Save mini documents when app gets inactive
    * `‚åò+S` now continues to save a scratch or shadow note instead of persisting it to a file. You can save it to a file using `File>Save to File...` menu item or using `‚åò+‚å•+S` key.
