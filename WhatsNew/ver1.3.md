## What's new in LightPaper version 1.3 Beta?

#### FEATURES ✨

* **Multiple Folders** -  📂🗄So many users have asked for this!!! Sidebar now supports multiple folders. Add as many as you want or remove the ones you don't want.
* **Editor Outline Navigator** - 🗺 Quickly navigate between your headers or code blocks. Access this from the bottom of your document window -- right next to word counter.

#### IMPROVEMENTS

* Shadow Notes now by default selects the active tab for both Chrome and Safari.
* `⌘+S` now continues to save a scratch or shadow note instead of persisting it to a file. You can save it to a file using `File>Save to File...` menu item or using `⌘+⌥+S` key.
* LightPaper now re-renders your document when you make any changes to your sidebar's root folder(s). This makes it to render your new/modified images without having to restart LightPaper, for an example 🖼.

#### B🐞G FIXES

* Type through autopair character if it is typed i.e. no more []] or ())
* Other few minor bug fixes

#### KNOWN ISSUES

* Quick Open sometimes fails to open a document.
* Shadow Notes navigator collapses every time you save or switch a note.
* Folder Navigator ignores any filters that have been applied from `Preferences...>Navigator`.
